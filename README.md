**Inspect the hidden layer-shell geometry that shapes the desktop around every window.**

Layer Atlas parses Hyprland's live layer tree and exposes each surface's monitor, layer level, namespace, geometry, process identity, and alpha.

## Built entirely in Ruby

All application behavior, system integration, and UI declarations are authored in
Ruby. There is no handwritten QML source. Omarchy UI compiles the Ruby-declared UI
into `OmarchyUI/Bundles/` and emits the three tiny root QML loader shims required by
the plugin manifest; those shims are generated packaging output.

## Why this is distinct

Window switchers inspect normal application windows. Layer Atlas is specifically for layer-shell surfaces such as bars, launchers, wallpapers, overlays, and locks.

The concept was checked against the complete Omarchy Plugin Marketplace catalog before development.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/AdamMusa/omarchy-layer-atlas.git --enable
```

The repository is self-contained. Omarchy UI asks Zui 0.0.10 to tree-shake the QML renderer at
bundle time, so users do not need Ruby or framework gems on the destination.

Review third-party plugin code before enabling it. Omarchy community plugins run with your user account.

## Use

Add **Layer Atlas** to the Omarchy bar and click its widget to open the panel. The plugin is keyboard-friendly, theme-aware, and designed for a 660 × 760 panel.

## Data, permissions, and safety

- Local state: `~/.local/state/omarchy-layer-atlas/state.json`
- State, command output, item counts, history, and rendered strings are bounded.
- State writes use an owner-only temporary file and atomic rename.
- System probes are read-only and invoke fixed argument arrays without a shell.

- No telemetry, analytics, remote account, package installation, or privileged command is used.
- The plugin never overwrites Omarchy, Hyprland, or application configuration.

External runtime tools are limited to standard commands already present on Omarchy when a feature needs them. Missing optional commands degrade to an explicit unavailable state. The exact commands are visible in [`lib/backend.rb`](lib/backend.rb).

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove izeesoft.layer-atlas
```

Removal leaves the local state file in place so reinstalling preserves history. To erase it too:

```bash
rm -r ~/.local/state/omarchy-layer-atlas
```
